[**StatMuse**](https://www.statmuse.com/) - This is basically like google for sports. You can basically ask any questions.. Example - Nick Chubb games w/ over 81 rushing yards last season and itll show up

[**RotoWire** ](https://www.rotowire.com/football/defense-vs-pos.php)- This will show how every defense did vs specific positions last season

[**TeamRankings**](https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stats/) - This will show how team defense without it being be specific position

[**Lineups**](https://www.lineups.com/nfl/player-stats) - Click on the drop down menu where it says player stats.. This I mainly use to for redzone stats/ snaps/ targets

[**PFF WR/CB Matchup Chart**](https://www.pff.com/tools/wr\_cb\_matchup\_chart) - This will show what players have good individual matchups according to PFF.. Also like to use this site for OL vs DL matchup

[**EV Analytics**](https://evanalytics.com/) - This is my favorite site for projections (Its a paid subscription but it is extremely worth it)

[**FTN Fantasy Air Yards**](https://www.ftnfantasy.com/air-yards) and [**Sharp Football Analysis**](https://www.sharpfootballanalysis.com/nfl-stats/defense/explosive-plays/team-rankings-explosive-plays-2021/) - Both these sites are mainly used for Longest reception prop. This shows how many plays defenses gave up last year and then you can the air yards for the offensive players
