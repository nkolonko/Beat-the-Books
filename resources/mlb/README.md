[**Underdog MLB Twitter**](https://twitter.com/Underdog\_\_MLB) - This twitter page will announce all the lineups, rain delays, ETC.

[**Props.Cash**](https://www.props.cash/) and [**Pine Sports**](https://www.pine-sports.com/) - I use both these sites to see how the players have been doing in their recent games.

[**StatMuse**](https://www.statmuse.com/) - Just like NBA you can basically treat this like google and ask this anything. I use this to see the game log for recent players and I also use this site to see how many HRs pitchers have given up in the season.

[**FanGraphs Pitcher Stats**](https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all\&stats=pit\&lg=all\&qual=0\&type=8\&season=2022\&month=0\&season1=2022\&ind=0\&team=0,ts\&rost=0\&age=0\&filter=\&players=0) - Used to breakdown pitchers.

[**FanGraphs Team Batting Stats**](https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all\&stats=bat\&lg=all\&qual=0\&type=8\&season=2022\&month=0\&season1=2022\&ind=0\&team=0,ts\&rost=\&age=\&filter=\&players=0) - Used to see individual batters AVG/ ISO vs LHP/ RHP. Can also use this site to see team's K rate percentage.

[**RotoGrinders PlateIQ**](https://rotogrinders.com/plateiq?sport=mlb) - This is a paid service I use so you might not be able to see everything I see without upgrading to the premium (I use this to see individual batters K % like the picture I normally post when I take a pitcher prop. I also use this site to see what pitches the pitcher throws vs either RHB or LHB. In this page you can also see the batters ISO vs those pitches but for the past 3 seasons)

[**RotoGrinders The Bat X**](https://rotogrinders.com/marketplace/derek-carty-s-the-bat-projection-system-300?sport=mlb) - This is another paid service that i use. (This is helpful for a bunch of different things. My favorite thing about this is "stack projections" which is normally for DFS but i use that as a way to see which players are good to target for more than just HRs)

[**EV Analytics**](https://evanalytics.com/) - This is also another paid service that I use. This site basically just points out certain plays that they believe are super +EV. For example, the day Jfar took Luplow 2+ HRs, this site has his ONE HR rated pretty high. This site also gives you their projections for players. I like to use that for pitcher props.

Those 3 paid services are all great and IMO super beneficial so I see them as an "investment"

[**Baseball Savant**](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) - then search the name of the player you want to look up (I use this site to see the players numbers for THIS season vs the pitches that he likes to throw which i see on RotoGrinders PlateIQ. I subtract SLG - BA to get the ISO)

[**Swish Analytics Pitcher vs Batter**](https://swishanalytics.com/optimus/mlb/batter-vs-pitcher-stats) - I don't personally use this but I know many other people do. This site shows you the batter vs pitcher matchup history

[**Ballpark Pal**](https://ballparkpal.com/index.php) - I use this site to see the weather, this site normally shows the weather and then also shows if its a good/ bad game for HRs. This site also does HRs boosts for certain players depending their matchup and I think this site is very accurate so lets say I like Trout/ Ohtani but this site shows Trout a much bigger HR boost than Ohtani I would play Trout
