# Pitcher Props

First let’s go into my favorite type of pitcher props to target, ranked in order of profitability and chances to get +EV spots

### **Pitcher Outs**

I know everyone loves strikeouts, and don’t worry we will get to that. But it’s important to understand how the pitcher outs prop works, and how it can be so profitable to target. Basically, pitcher outs is a bet on how many innings a pitcher lasts. There are 3 outs in an inning, so you can simply multiply a pitcher’s IP by 3 to get their pitcher outs (So if a pitcher pitches 6.0 innings, he had 18 pitcher outs). What’s important to understand here is a pitcher is most likely to get taken out at the end of an inning. As a basic rule, most managers want their really good pitchers to go 6 innings, and for their so-so pitchers to go 5 innings. That means this prop revolves around two numbers, **15 and 18**. This is why I am so adamant at targeting O17.5 pitcher outs props for good pitchers. Even in an outing where an ace doesn’t have his full stuff, he will often give you 6 innings and then get pulled. O14.5 is a rare prop for books to offer, but it offers value in a similar way, as a manager REALLY wants to get at least 5 innings out of almost any starter.

For this prop, you want to target pitchers who throw lots of pitches, who throw strikes and don’t walk batters, and most importantly pitchers who have their manager’s trust. That mound visit in the 6th inning is always scary. You want your guy to tell the manager “fuck off, let me finish”.

### **Pitcher Strikeouts**

The very first thing you should check is the matchup that a pitcher has. You can check a teams K% history by pitcher handedness on [FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders/splits-leaderboards?splitArr=\&splitArrPitch=\&position=B\&autoPt=false\&splitTeams=false\&statType=team\&statgroup=2\&startDate=2023-03-01\&endDate=2023-11-01\&players=\&filter=\&groupBy=season\&wxTemperature=\&wxPressure=\&wxAirDensity=\&wxElevation=\&wxWindSpeed=\&sort=4,1), and you can analyze the K% for that day’s lineup on [PlateIQ](https://rotogrinders.com/plateiq?sport=mlb). A really good strikeout matchup is so important, and it can make a very bad strikeout pitcher look like Nolan Ryan. On the flipside, teams who don’t strikeout typically just don’t strikeout, even if you face them against a really good ace. Now let’s go quickly through some of my fav stats to look for on pitchers

**xFIP:** Basically a much better stat to use than ERA in almost every context imaginable. This stat aims to show how good a pitcher is without taking their defense into account. The lower xFIP, the better. Use this to determine how good a pitcher truly is

**Velo/Spin Rates:** To put it simply, you want a pitcher who has a pitch that is either very fast, has very strong movement, or both. There are a million stats that aim to show this (there’s even a stat literally called "Stuff”). You can check these rates on Savant.

**Contact %/Swinging Strike %:** Two stats that are measured oppositely but basically portray the same concept. These show how often a batter makes contact with a pitcher’s arsenal. Ideally, you want a low contact % and a high swinging strike %. This one is super important, as if you’re betting over on strikeouts, then every ground out and fly out is an awful outcome (even though it’s good for the pitcher in real life)

**Ahead %:** This one is slept on, but this details how often a pitcher gets ahead of the count. You really want this for strikeouts, as an 0-2 or 1-2 count allows the pitcher to throw outside of the zone and fish for strikeouts. When the count fills up, they are less likely to go for strikeouts like this.

All of these stats can be found on [PlateIQ](https://rotogrinders.com/plateiq?sport=mlb), [FanGraphs ](https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders/splits-leaderboards?splitArr=\&splitArrPitch=\&position=B\&autoPt=false\&splitTeams=false\&statType=team\&statgroup=2\&startDate=2023-03-01\&endDate=2023-11-01\&players=\&filter=\&groupBy=season\&wxTemperature=\&wxPressure=\&wxAirDensity=\&wxElevation=\&wxWindSpeed=\&sort=4,1)or [Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/custom?year=2023\&type=pitcher\&filter=\&sort=4\&sortDir=asc\&min=q\&selections=xba,xslg,xwoba,xobp,xiso,exit\_velocity\_avg,launch\_angle\_avg,barrel\_batted\_rate,\&chart=false\&x=xba\&y=xba\&r=no\&chartType=beeswarm).

### **Pitcher To Record a Win:**

This is my third favorite pitcher prop, and one of the most versatile. First, how does a pitcher record a win? Well, they have to pitch at least 5 innings, their team has to have the lead when they get pulled, and their team cannot ever let go of the lead once the pitcher is gone. So to succeed with picking “Yes” for this prop, you want to pick a pitcher who’s going to pitch a really long time, not allow a lot of runs, and also have their team provide good run support.

Another great use for this prop is using the “No” option. Now, I would almost never take this prop by itself, as the usual targets will have their lines set at -300 or worse. However, it is an incredible way to cut the juice on an actual play that you want to target that is priced at -160 or so. For this you want the opposite; a pitcher who likely isn’t going to pitch long, who is pitching for a massive underdog, and who is frankly likely to get his shit rocked. You can even SGP pitcher props on books like Caesars, Bet365 and Barstool. In this case, taking a pitchers under on outs/strikeouts and combining it with his own “No Win” prop is extremely valuable.
