# Pace in NBA

When I see people breakdown NBA plays, there is a lot of talk about matchups (such as: X team allows the 4th most points to Y position so this play is good). Matchup data is great, but is only one piece of the puzzle, so I want to keep giving you guys other angles to look at. The funny thing is, a LOT of matchup data can simply be explained by pace. So ok, what is pace?

Pace refers to the amount of possessions that a team uses in a game. If a team has a high pace rating, that means that they are getting in more possessions in a game than a team with a low pace rating. Why is this important? Well of course, every possession is another chance for whatever prop you bet on to get closer to hitting.

This makes sense if you check the pace stats. Some of our favorite matchups to target all year are teams that are top of the league in pace (Lakers, Spurs, Hornets, Pacers etc.). On the flip, the tough matchup teams are right at the bottom in pace (Cavs, Mavericks before trade, Raptors etc.)

Here's the REAL alpha though: Not only do you get more possessions in a high pace game, you often get BETTER SHOTS. Why? Because high pace teams get out on the fast break. This transforms the game from a slow half-court style to an on-the-break frenzy. On-the-break shots are better looks than the ones you get from half-court sets, and ESPECIALLY with the emergence of the fast-break three in the NBA, this can be huge

So next time we talk about a "pace-up" spot, just know we mean that a slow pace team is playing a fast pace team, and you should target props on the slower team in this case. JB last night was a great example, as Celtics are one of the slowest teams in the league, and the Wolves are one of the fastest.
