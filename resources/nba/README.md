[**Underdog\_NBA Twitter**](https://twitter.com/Underdog\_\_NBA) - This twitter page gives you the fastest updates on injuries and starting lineups. I have their notifications on.

[**FantasyPros Defense vs Position**](https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/defense-vs-position.php?fbclid=IwAR0c7jIqn0fJquxItr9WQ22uH48h1Sfbq23LDfTHVt8UpXRe8uoUmuT2o3k) - This site shows how individual teams matchup vs each position. You can also sort how each team has done vs each position in the last 30/15/7 games and also the season.

[**TeamRankings**](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/opponent-points-in-paint-per-game?fbclid=IwAR3AZb0t8SKRnnKPQUt-DyDnUVCp\_JSo3DgmKioEqxUsZZIdGov1ClS3z94) - This site shows team rankings vs basically any stat you want to sort it by.

[**DailyRoto Lineup Optimizer**](https://dailyroto.com/nba-lineup-optimizer/) - This is the site i use for minute projections for each team. This site also updates on its own as players get ruled in/ out.

[**StatMuse**](https://www.statmuse.com/) - You can basically look up ANYTHING on this site. I use this site for game logs, how players have played vs certain teams, etc. Just treat this like google for sports.

[**Props.Cash**](https://www.props.cash/) - This website will show how often a player has hit props in either the last 5/10 games or the season.

[**Potential Assist Tracker**](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2021-22\&SeasonType=Regular%20Season\&sort=POTENTIAL\_AST\&dir=1) - (This website will show how many potential assists a player had. I like this sort because you can sort it by however you want)

[**RotoGrinders**](https://rotogrinders.com/) - This website gives us the projected pace for each game. You can find that in the "NBA DFS First look article" which gets posted every morning. IF you have a paid subscription for rotogrinders in CourtIQ you can see if certain players get a usage rate boost when certain players are out.
