# Understanding Showdown

With a single game Thursday coming up, I think it’s a great time to breakdown the “Showdown” contests in DFS

Showdown slates, or single-game slates, are a format of DFS that differs slightly from slates with 2 or more games. Instead of selecting a full lineup with a QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs etc., you have a condensed format made for the limited amount of options in a single game. I’m going to breakdown how showdown works for both Fanduel and DraftKings, as well as what strategies to use.

### **FANDUEL SINGLE GAME**

The Fanduel single game format consists of 5 unlimited position picks, which means all 5 slots can be either a QB, WR, TE, RB or Kicker. You select one of these options to be your MVP, which means they will earn 1.5x of their normal points. MVP/Captain selection is probably the most crucial part of showdown on both sites, so it’s important to understand how it works. On Fanduel, you do NOT have to pay extra salary to make a guy your MVP, this is different on DK which I will explain later.

As far as contest selection goes, I would almost NEVER play cash games on Fanduel single game slates. Because you don’t have to pay extra for MVPs, often times Fanduel single games end up having an extreme amount of duplicate or near duplicate lineups. If you leave out one guy who goes off, you’re likely going to end up in the bottom 50% anyway. Because of this, I strictly play tournaments with FD single games. My strategy usually is to play the most optimal lineup, with one or two sneaky switches that I know will go underowned. That way, if my sneaky pick is right, it will propel me way above all the other people who played the same lineup anyway. I have taken down or gotten close to take down many times just doing this, it’s crazy how much leverage you can get.

### **DRAFTKINGS SHOWDOWN**

On DraftKings, it’s an entirely different story. First of all, you have to pay 1.5x more salary if you make a guy your Captain/MVP. This creates a huge skill gap, as if you select a very high salary guy for your Captain, you will eat up a very large portion of your salary and quite frankly the rest of your team will probably suck. With this in mind, cash games and tournaments are both viable on DK, and I far prefer to do showdown on this site rather than Fanduel. In my opinion, the two best strategies here are to either make a very strong WR your Captain and try to abuse PPR, or you can punt your Captain to save salary and go with a balanced build. Much more nuance here. I have seen some very creative lineups take down showdown on DK. Some people even use backup QBs and get there, the possibilities are much greater.



To summarize, only play tournaments for single-game slates on Fanduel, and for DraftKings play what you want, but make sure you take into account ownership.
