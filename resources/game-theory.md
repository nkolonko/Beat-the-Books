# Game Theory

What is game theory? On a simple level, game theory is the study of the inter-dependency between the active and rational variables in a given system.&#x20;

_Jfar wtf that wasnt simple..._&#x20;

Ok ok, think of it as situations where more than one person's input affects the situation. Let's use an example.&#x20;

Say that you have to drive home, and you have the choice of using two different interstates to get there. Both interstates are equally as far from the crib, but you know for a fact that one of them always has heavy traffic at this time of day. You probably will use the highway with less traffic, and get home faster. In that instance you used a simple understanding of game theory. The traffic was caused by other people making the decision to use one highway, so you took that information and decided to use a different route.

Ok boring explanation out of the way, what does this have to do with sports betting? This is where mindset is important. A lot of people don't see sports betting as a game against other people. Usually they think of a bet, boot up Fanduel, and bet it no matter what. But in reality, you are going against so many people when you make a bet. You are going against any other person or entity that took the other side of your bet, making it a zero-sum game. Then, you're also going against the books who want to take their cut, making it even WORSE than a zero-sum game. To get an advantage, you have to gain an edge over **other people**. If you approach it in any other way, you have already lost.

I have a personal approach to this that follows a few principles. The first principle is to understand how other people think. Using game theory in a competitive aspect is the most effective when you understand what the other parties are thinking. In sports betting, this isn't hard to do. There is so much data tracking the public perception of bets, and you can bet the books are on top of this as well. For example, if a game between two offensive teams is slated, that game will most likely have a very high total. The public will see a high total and want to bet offense, so naturally the books will lower prop values to match that. Our approach can't be that simple, which leads to the next principle

Finding optimal and unorthodox solutions to obvious situations. This one is key, and it will get you an immediate edge over most people. It is incredibly easy to point to a game that will have offense, but how do you best take advantage? I think the surge of the RBI market in baseball provides the perfect example. For years the most popular bets for offense have been total bases or home runs, which the books had prepared for. RBIs were a new way to capitalize on high offense games with much more value. Being on top of this type of value is crucial to long-term success.

Lastly, it is important to understand how the statistics that you study relate to each other. Understanding how different stats can interact with each other and correlate is the final cherry on top of this thinking. If we're being completely honest, there is only so much value you can extract by betting a single prop. Of course sometimes you catch the books slipping on an early line, or maybe you just project a player higher than the book does and you make a good call. But most of the time, if you were to check all of the lines for a game 10 minutes before it started, they would be very very close to fair value. The books make money for a reason.

But where you can catch them slipping, is when you find the right way to combo these things together. I think the most obvious example of this is stacking, where you take multiple members from the same team in hopes that their efforts combine with each other for your idea to work. After all, if a team scores a million points/runs/goals, then some props have to hit right? This line of thinking is sound, and the books know this as well. Often times, they will insert algorithms into their "same game parlays" to reduce the odds when you find good examples of correlation.

**but there are weaknesses.**

This is where the work is. The real money can be found in finding these weaknesses before the books catch on. This sports betting boom is still pretty new, and there are still methods that some popular books are frankly just sleeping on. But the only way to find them, is to take great data/projections, combine them with smart thinking and game theory knowledge, and to get a step or two ahead.
