# Link Between Odds and Probability

### Introduction

The goal of sports betting shouldn’t be to accurately predict the outcome of sporting events as much as possible.  This seems counterintuitive at first, but it’s not the goal of sportsbooks, and it’s not the goal of professional bettors. It shouldn’t be your goal, either, because the real objective is to make money.

Now I know what you’re thinking: You can’t make money if your bets don’t hit. This is absolutely true–but you can still be profitable even while losing the vast majority of your bets. It’s fundamental to understand this if you plan to regularly tail the BTB cappers. It’s also important to understand that while books and bettors have the same goal of making money, they have entirely different approaches to achieving it.&#x20;

My goal here is not to write a comprehensive guide to betting like the pros, but to provide a basic foundation that helps new members understand key concepts for making smarter bets. I will try to be concise and keep the math at a minimum, but hopefully this serves as a jumping off point to reading more intermediate and advanced pieces for those who are interested in digging deeper. The three basic areas I’ll cover here are 1) the relationship between an odds line and probability; 2) how books use these lines to make money; 3) how understanding 1 and 2 can help you make money, especially while on BTB.

### The relationship between an odds line and probability

Probably the most overlooked and misunderstood aspect of sports betting, especially for newer bettors, is that an odds line isn’t just an indication of payout. In fact, it correlates to a probability that an event will occur. We understand that the term “coin flip” means there is a 50% chance something will happen, and 50% chance it won’t. Similarly, we understand that a +100, or even money, bet also implies the same 50% chance that something will happen.

American odds, in particular, tend to obscure the fact that all odds lines also imply some probability.  +200, for instance, implies a 33.33% chance something will happen, while -200 implies a 66.66% chance. While there are formulas you can use to convert any odds to a probability, and there are odds-to-probability calculators you can find online (and I highly recommend bookmarking one you like!), here’s a simple way to understand it: Most of us recognize +200 as a “2 to 1 payout” or “2:1 odds.”  What that means is that if an event happens 3 times, then a +200 bet would be expected to NOT happen 2 of those times, and would happen only once. Or:

\
_1 times it does happen / 3 total times = 33.33% probability_



The negative version of +200 (-200) is the remaining 66.67% probability.

\
The last section will get into this a bit more, but this has massive implications for making money. The most important is this: If you regularly make bets at the +200 odds range, you don’t have to win all, or even most, of your bets to be profitable.  You only have to be right more often than the probability of 33.33%.  As long as you win more than 1 in 3 bets you place at this level, you will make money. Put another way: If you bet $100 at +200 and win, you get a $300 payout ($200 winnings + $100 stake).  If you make 100 bets of $100 at +200, and lose 60 of those bets, you’ll still make a profit of $2,000:



_100 bets \* $100 = $10,000 total bet_\
_$300 payout \* 40 winning bets = $12,000 total payout_\
_$12,000 payout - $10,000 bet = $2,000 profit._



That’s a 20% profit even though you only had a 40% accuracy rate! Not only does this work for any odds line, but the longer the odds, the more you can afford to be wrong while making a similar profit (and the shorter the odds, the more accurate you have to be).  This is why you should be skeptical of any capper who only touts their record of winning and losing bets, and why the units won is so much more important than a betting record. If a capper tells you they are right 58% of the time, but they are regularly making bets at around -200 (66.66% probability), then they are losing money overall.

### How books use lines to make money

At this point, it’s easy to assume that if bettors just have to be right more often than the probability of their bets, then that’s what books are also doing to make money.  That assumption isn’t true, though, and it’s important to understand what the books are actually trying to do.

This is going to be overly simplified and basic, but let’s go back to a 50% probability bet.  We know that +100 is a 50% probability, but you’ll almost never see, for example, a moneyline bet that offers +100 on both teams. No, most often for a close game you’ll see something around -110 for both.  -110 implies a probability of 52.38%, and that extra 2.38% is the “juice” or the “vig.”  Most bettors understand this, but don’t think about the implications.  What this means is that as long as there are an equal number of bets/cash wagered on both sides, the losers’ stakes pay out the winners’, and the book makes a profit regardless of outcome:



_50 people \* $110 bet on Team A = $5,500 bet on Team A_\
_50 people \* $110 bet on Team B = $5,500 bet on Team B_\
_$5,500 Team A bets + $5,500 Team B bets = $11,000 total bets_\
_50 people \* $210 winning payout = $10,500 in total payouts, regardless of outcome_\
_$11,000 total bets - $10,500 total payouts = $500 profit for book either way_



This also works on our +200/-200 example, too.  Once you add in a couple points of juice, you would likely see odds around +180/-220. In this case, as long as the books can get about 1/3 of the bets on the +180 side and 2/3 of the bets on the -220, they will profit.



_50 people \* $100 bets on Team A = $5,000_\
_100 people \* $100 bets on Team B = $10,000_



_50 people \* $280 winning payout = $14,000 total payouts_\
_$15,000 total bets - $14,000 total payouts = $1,000 profit for book_

**-OR-**

_100 people \* $145.45 winning payouts = $14,545 total payouts_\
_$15,000 total bets - $14,545 total payouts = $455 profit for book_



Again, the book makes a profit regardless of the outcome.&#x20;

The takeaway here is simple: In order to make a profit, books don’t have to set accurate lines, they have to set lines that attract a proportional amount of bets (or cash wagered) on each side of the market.  This is one reason why you see lines move before an event starts: If the money on one side becomes disproportionate to the probability of that side, they need to make it more attractive for the next group of bettors to take the opposite side. The actual probability likely hasn’t changed at all, but the book’s equation to earn a profit regardless of outcome has changed.  In fact, if the actual probability has changed–say, because of a lineup change–books aren’t likely to just change their line immediately; instead you will probably see them lock the market and not accept bets until they can establish a new line.

The bottom line, though, is what we said at the outset: Books aren’t necessarily trying to accurately predict outcomes, they are trying to make money.  And if you want to Beat the Books, you have to understand this.

### How you can use this information to make money

Even though a book’s primary goal is to attract proportional bets to each side, that doesn’t mean their odds are completely divorced from probability. Bettors are at least sophisticated enough to know that a +180 bet on the Denver Nuggets to beat the Detroit Pistons is a lot smarter than betting -220 on the Pistons to win. If books set these lines, they would almost certainly lose money quickly. And to the extent the books’ probability may be off slightly, the collective wisdom of the betting public often helps push lines closer to true probability in many markets (think of it as a form of crowdsourcing probability).

This is especially true for markets that are heavily bet, like money lines and spreads, and in sports like college football or the NBA.  But what about markets that aren’t bet as often, or where it may be harder for individual bettors to determine true probability? The answer is that the book’s lines are probably further away from the true probability, and that presents an opportunity.

As I mentioned above, if the probability of something happening is 33.33%, you should expect to bet it at around +200, and you would need to be right more than 1 out of 3 times to make a profit.  So if you see it at +300, that’s a huge discrepancy and you probably want to bet it immediately.  Why? Consider our previous example, but with +300 odds instead, so that your payout is now $400 instead of $300:

\
_100 bets \* $100 = $10,000 total bet_\
_$400 payout \* 40 winning bets = $16,000 total payout_\
_$12,000 payout - $10,000 bet = $6,000 profit._



Without changing your winning percentage of 40%, you’ve tripled your profit to 60%.  Now, this probably isn’t realistic, but the other implication is that you can again afford to be wrong more often if you find this sort of discrepancy between probability and odds line.  So while our original example required you to get 40% of bets right to make a 20% profit at +200, at +300, you would only have to be right 30% of the time for a 20% profit ($400 payout \* 30 winning bets = $12,000 total payout).  Finding this sort of discrepancy is often referred to as “good value” or a “good price.”

On the flip side, the discrepancy could go the other way.  Instead of a line that should be around +200, it could be +150.  If you’re right 40% of the time, you’re only going to break even ($250 payout \* 40 winning bets = $10,000 total payout).  And if your winning percentage matches the true probability of 33.33%, that means you’re losing money ($250 payout \* 33 winning bets = $8,250 total payout, or a loss of $1,750). Finding this sort of discrepancy is often referred to as “too much juice” or a “bad price.”

The trick, then, is to find bets whose odds suggest a worse probability than reality, because it allows you to make bigger profits even if you win individual bets less often. Again, the goal is just to win more often than the odds suggest you should, and even winning slightly more often means you’ll earn some level of profit. This means consistently finding the markets where the book’s line is off in the right direction, and that usually means digging into props; into sports like hockey, soccer or golf; and into games that are bet on less often (like mid-major college football and basketball). This is hard to do profitably on NFL spreads, for instance, because heavy public betting has probably pushed the line close to 50% probability, and after accounting for the book’s juice you’d have to be right at least 53% of the time on something that’s a coin flip at best. It isn’t impossible to be profitable here, but you’ve got to be very disciplined and picky.

### How to apply this knowledge with BTB

Many professional bettors build complex mathematical models that allow them to determine probability, and then compare that output to listed odds to find good discrepancies (sometimes referred to as ‘edge’).  Most of us aren’t that sophisticated, though, so how can we use this basic knowledge, along with BTB insight, to make smarter bets? Here are a few takeaways.

1. No matter the betting style, profitability depends on outperforming the probability behind it. It doesn’t matter if the capper you follow bets spreads, prop ladders, or lottos: If they aren’t beating the probability, they aren’t making money. In fact, while you might win more often betting spreads than lottos, it can often be easier to make an overall profit betting lottos because you have the freedom to lose a lot more often. You might not have the risk tolerance for constant lotto betting, so don’t feel obligated to tail a capper with that style just because you might end up in the same profitable space as someone who bets more straights. Making money should still be fun.
2. Successful sports betting is a high volume affair, usually with more individual losses than wins. The reason sports books offer lucrative sign-up bonuses is that they know over the long term most bettors are going to lose money.  They will earn back those bonuses, and then some. If you want to beat them, you have to take the long term view, too.  At +200 odds/33% probability, you might win 6 of the first 10 bets.  But the thing about probability is that after 100 bets, you will probably be closer to 33 wins than to 60.  After 1,000 bets, you’ll almost certainly be closer to 330 wins than to 600. Don’t get caught up in individual bets winning or losing, and don’t get caught up in a capper’s wins-losses record. Realize, too, that only picking and choosing some bets to tail means you miss out on volume, and are less likely to see the same level of success your cappers or others in the community have. It’s fine to pick and choose if that’s your preference, but don’t judge their entire performance based upon your own random sample of their plays.
3. BTB Cappers can help you find the good discrepancies (and avoid the bad discrepancies) between odds line and probability. You probably aren’t building your own sophisticated models like professional bettors do, but sometimes even basic research can give you some kind of edge.  You probably don’t always have time for in-depth research across multiple games, but the cappers here put in that work and are proven to be able to find the edge you need to maximize winnings on hot streaks, and minimize losses on cold streaks.  For instance: In this past NBA season, Joel Embiid scored the first basket in a game about 25% of the time, which would imply odds of about +300, but he was regularly listed to score first at +250 to +270. In any given game, he probably had the highest probability of scoring first…and yet if you bet him every game at those listed prices you would have lost money. If you follow JPWVOH, you saw him repeatedly warn people about playing Embiid at those odds, and picking someone like Tobias Harris at +1000 instead. That’s only a 9% implied probability, but it means you only have to win 1 out of 10 times on that bet on Harris to make a profit. If JPWVOH is picking him there, chances are he’s done extensive research for you to know that the probability in that matchup is much better than 1 in 10.
4. You should bet at or near the posted odds of a play. I pointed out earlier that a probability of 33.33% with a line of +300 is good value, and a line of +150 is bad value. If a capper posts a play at +300 and it drops to +150, realize it has probably switched from a good play to a bad play. Again, the cappers aren’t trying to accurately predict what will happen as much as they are trying to find a price and probability they can outperform. While the actual outcome may be the same, consistently tailing plays at much shorter odds than identified will erode your ability to outperform probability, and will erode your ability to make a profit over time. Similarly, the same play posted at different odds on different books may mean that the play is good at one book and bad at the other, even though the actual probability is the same.&#x20;

This is just a starting point, but once you understand the relationship between odds and probability it’s much easier to spot good value. Even if you don’t like to only tail other people’s picks, BTB cappers can help point you in the direction to find value consistently, and give you ideas for your own plays. More importantly, understanding how to use this info to make a profit even with a losing record makes cold streaks easier to handle, and provides a strong foundation for staying disciplined in bankroll management and unit betting.
