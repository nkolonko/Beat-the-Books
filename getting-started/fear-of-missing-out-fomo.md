# Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

Let’s take a quick second and let’s talk about what it means to tail a profitable capper.&#x20;

As most of you know, we encourage every member in here to tail 1-3 cappers, tail every play and to follow the results using the recaps. Very often what we see happen is someone starts like this, but then they notice that a capper that they weren’t tailing hits a big play.&#x20;

“I should’ve been tailing that guy the whole time! I’m gonna drop everything and tail him now”&#x20;

And then what happens? The guy you were tailing before starts going crazy&#x20;

“Shit!! He never hits when I tail him fine I’ll go back and start tailing him now”&#x20;

Then the guy you just left hits again&#x20;

“FUCK. Ok maybe if I go back…”&#x20;

**STOP THIS DUMB SHIT**&#x20;

You **CANNOT PREDICT** when a capper you are tailing is going to hit. The point is to pick someone with a profitable track record, and to keep tailing them. The road is going to be bumpy at times, that is unavoidable. You can’t be so quick to switch up.

Also, do you know how hard it is to hit once, let alone back to back to back? If you start tailing someone after a big hit, you will very often catch them right as the hot streak is ending. It’s actually one of the worst things you can do.

Have some faith y’all. We can’t be judging after a day or two
