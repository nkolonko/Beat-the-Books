# Managing Your Bankroll and Unit Size

The key to being profitable long term is proper bankroll management.

We all suggest unit gambling, which means to bet 1-3% of your bankroll per bet. This helps you manage your bankroll and makes it much harder for you to lose your entire bankroll on one single day, like many irresponsible bettors do.

Below are some examples of how your unit sizes should be based on your overall sports betting bankroll.

Total Bankroll: $100\
1U = $1\
0.5U = $0.50\
0.25U = $0.25\
0.1U = $0.10\
\
Total Bankroll: $1,000\
1U = $10\
0.5U = $5.00\
0.25U = $2.50\
0.1U = $1.00\


Total Bankroll: $10,000\
1U = $100\
0.5U = $50.00\
0.25U = $25.00\
0.1U = $10.00\


We like to say sports gambling is a marathon, not a sprint. Please ensure that you are using correct bankroll management and unit sizes when tailing plays. Failing to do so will eventually deplete your entire bankroll. There is no reason you should not have enough units to tail the 1-3 recommended cappers, as you should have close to 100 units every day.

As your bankroll begins to fluctuate, you will need to change your unit size. We typically recommend adjusting your unit size once you are either up or down 12.5 units, however this should always be handled case by case. Below are some examples of how you should be adjusting your bankroll.

**Increasing Unit Size**

Starting Bankroll: $1,000 ($10 Units)\
Last 7 Days: +$150 (+15 Units)\
New Unit Size: $11.50

**Decreasing Unit Size**

Starting Bankroll: $1,000 ($10 Units)\
Last 7 Days: -$150 (-15 Units)\
New Unit Size: $8.50

You don't need to change your unit size every day, but it should be adjusted as your overall bankroll changes.
