# Choosing a Capper

To be successful in Beat the Books, we recommend choosing between 1 and 3 cappers to tail and **FOLLOW ALL OF THEIR PLAYS.** Picking and choosing plays from each capper is not a good strategy to use here.

If you don't know what cappers you want to tail, look at each of their plays for a day and get an idea of their betting style. You can also choose who to tail based on what sports they make picks for.&#x20;

Below is a list of our cappers and what sports they make picks for. You can view their picks in the **╔═══ Official Picks ═══╗** category, along with a recap for each night's results in the [#team-recaps ](https://discord.com/channels/929785309087014923/1017115133635477614)channel.

**Note:** Cappers will post their NFL Picks in the **╔══ NFL Official Picks ══╗** category, and their NBA Picks in the **╔══ NBA Official Picks ══╗** category.
